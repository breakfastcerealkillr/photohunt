# About Photo Hunt #

Combining a traditional scavenger hunt with mobile phones, Photo Hunt allows [Bishop Museum](http://www.bishopmuseum.org/) visitors to submit pictures of specific items found within the Museum. Given a scavenger hunt list, visitors become explorers -- on the search for ancient secrets and hidden artifacts, while creating an interactive environment between Bishop Museum visitors and its exhibits.

Photo Hunt is also a web application that accepts, categorizes and awards points for picture submissions, displaying winning submissions online and at the end of a visitor's journey. This gives Bishop Museum staff the ability to gauge interest in certain exhibits, approve or disapprove certain images, and create new scavenger hunt games.
