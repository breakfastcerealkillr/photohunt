  This week there were only a couple of files that needed to be committed among the both of us for version 1.0.

  Everyone wrote JUnit tests for their code, so there are now more JUnit testing data for the both of us.

  The focus this week was mostly on requirements, so there was not a lot of time spent on development.  After the meeting on Wednesday, George spent time working on programming while Elayne finished up the requirements.

  George did not commit his code yet, so there are no commits this week.

  George ran some tests on his code to make sure they worked.
