  Very little work was done this past week, but it is slowly picking back up.  A lot of time was spent researching various technologies like [http://www.hibernate.org Hibernate], J2EE security, and [http://labs.jboss.com/portal/jbossrichfaces RichFaces].

  Since very little work was done this week, there were no commits.

  Again, since little work was done, there were no unit tests run.  What work was done by George was mostly web design work.
